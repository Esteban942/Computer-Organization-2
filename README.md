# COMPUTER ORGANIZATION 2
This repository showcases my work for Computer Organization 2, where I developed a kernel from scratch as part of the course. Through this project, I implemented and explored core operating system concepts, including:

- Assembly Language and C Programming for low-level system development.
- Memory Management: Virtual memory, paging, and dynamic memory allocation.
- Protected Mode: Configuration of the GDT (Global Descriptor Table) and segmentation.
- Interrupt Handling: Management of hardware and software interrupts, including exceptions.
- System Calls (Syscalls): Implementation of user-to-kernel communication mechanisms.
- Context Switching: Management of processes and multitasking.
- Timer Configuration: Setting up a system clock for task scheduling and time management.
- I/O Management: Interaction with hardware devices and peripherals.

Also I uploaded a mid-term exam, where I implemented a Doubly Linked List using assembly.
